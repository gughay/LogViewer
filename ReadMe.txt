Hi there,

First of all, dont judge stricly please, this project under the development and 
I should apply some improvments for hard coded parts in order to complete).
I am developing this project for local needs in our company.This is my idea and our managers approved it.
Each time we want to fix bags we should open SQL Server and find appropriate errors in db (created by NLog  from our projects).
In order to avoid this boring process and have all errors in one place, I decided to create a web application for  logs (Log Viewer).
Also I plan to integrate signalr in this project to have real time logs notifications from server to all clients.
So this is a n-tier application with asp.net core on server side and  angular on client side.
